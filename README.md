### Description

Battleship II is a Java-based implementation of the classic game Battleship with a twist. The game supports multiple players and features a unique scoring system. The game ends when only one player remains in play.
The version of the Battleship game is described in [this document](/docs/project.md). With information about the players' names, the arrangement of their fleets, and the sequence of shots taken, the program should be able to indicate, at any point in the game, each playerâ€™s score and fleet state, the players' ranking, and which players are still in the game. It is also intended that, while the game is not over, the program can indicate who the next player to take a shot is.
