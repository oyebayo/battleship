The right column provides information for the reader, serving only as a reminder of the rules described earlier. In this column, “c” abbreviates “cells(s)” and “pts” abbreviates “points”. To distinguish between input and output, the input has been printed in blue, while the output is in black. All input and output lines end with a newline symbol, which has been omitted for readability. 

The column on the left provides comments or a description on the interaction.
