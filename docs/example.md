The listing provides information for the reader, serving only as a reminder of the rules described earlier.  To distinguish between input and output, the input has been printed in blue. All input and output lines end with a newline symbol, which has been omitted for readability. 

The text in gray provides comments or a description on the interaction. In the text, “c” abbreviates “cells(s)” and “pts” abbreviates “points”.
