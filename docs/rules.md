## main.Game Rules

Two or more players compete against each other. Before the game begins, each player arranges their ships on their grid (being required to have at least one boat), and the order in which players play is defined. One player takes a turn at a time. The player taking the turn rotates, respecting the previously defined order, and considering that after the last player, it is the first player’s turn again. For example, if there are four players identified by the names A, B, C, and D, and this is the order in which they play: the first player to play is player A; after A plays, it is the turn of player B; after B plays, it is the turn of player C; after C plays, it is the turn of player D; after D plays, it is again the turn of player A.

At the beginning of the game, all players are in play (no player has been eliminated), and all have zero points. However, when a player’s fleet is completely sunk, that player is immediately eliminated: the player no longer plays (does not take any more shots), and their grid cannot be the target of opponents’ shots. The elimination of a player does not change the order in which the remaining players take their turns. If the initial order were A, B, C, and D (as in the example above), and C were eliminated, after B plays, it would be D’s turn unless D has also been eliminated. If both C and D have been eliminated, after B plays, it would be A’s turn. The game ends as soon as there is only one player in play.

While the game has not ended, the player with the right to play chooses an opponent to attack and takes a shot at a position on that opponent’s grid, with one of the following three situations occurring:
 - If there is a ship in that position, the ship sinks (ceases to exist). The player earns as many points as the number of cells on the ship multiplied by 100.
 - If there has never been a ship in that position, the player’s score remains unchanged.
 - If there is no ship in that position because the existing ship was sunk, the player loses as many points as the number of cells on the sunken ship multiplied by 30.

In the last move of the game, the surviving player (the one who took the shot) receives a bonus: after earning the “regular” points for sinking a ship, the score is doubled. The winner is the player with the highest score when the game ends; if there is more than one player with the highest score, the survivor wins, even if their score is not the highest. From the moment the game ends, no player can take shots. Consequently, the players’ scores and fleet states can no longer change. Note that the score can be positive, zero, or negative.
